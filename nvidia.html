      Ever since I built my first computer on my own from scratch at age 14 I
      always messed with the graphics configuration before even looking at the
      start game, it was not until I looked at my friends graphic configurations
      that I realized that this is not what most people do. After building my
      computer I spent the next two years looking in youtube and forums for ways
      to get the most out of my hardware when gaming, I was doomed to having to
      do way too much research and troubleshooting since I mostly play 3d
      first-person shooters and I really liked them 100+ frames per second, but
      my hardware and budget were on the lower end of the spectrum, so I
      resourced to benchmark and trying every possible config to be able to
      click heads comfortably.<br /><br />

      Ever since I found about Nvidia's geforce now I fell in love with the
      cloud gaming technology since it could save so much time for an
      experienced user to skip the installation process and simplify the
      graphics configuration process by being able to just select preference for
      performance, fidelity or balance. When I found how convinient cloud gaming
      was and what Nvidia's hardware was able to do with ray tracing a couple of
      years later, I decided that I would do everything in my power to one day
      work at Nvidia and contribute to the cutting edge gaming technologies.
